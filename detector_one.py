# An obstacle detection module using 2D Lidar scans needs to be developed. 
# A rosbag containing a lidar scan topic is provided. 
# The environment contains one or more moving objects. 
# When objects are within the range of 2 metres, a ros message should be published as an output. 
# The message should contain the number of obstacles, the distances to the obstacles 
# (average distance in metres (d)) and the sizes of obstacles (in terms of start angle (SA), end angle (EA)).
#  Check the following figure for details:



obstacle_distances=0
obstacle_count=0
end_angle=0
start_angle=0
obstacle_avg_dist=0 

#what is ranges? what does it represent? means? is it an array of distances?  
# objects are moving 
# angle min and max are given in radians 
# seq im guessing is the message number
# stamp is timestamp?
# what is angle increment? angle between 2 consecutive laser beams
# wats scan time? how do uk we dont need it
# wats range min and max? ok so it cant detect obj closer than 25cm? ok those r edge cases
# now the array ranges in my head makes sense. this means its the length of the beams. 
# what are intensities?
# its essentially mapping out the region fr us
# lets take first 4 items in the array
# find out y for next 2 points. 

# [2.1640000343322754, 2.1600000858306885, 2.1559998989105225,  2.1600000858306885]
# 
# now how to get value of y with just angle? we know value of hypotenuse from array we know theta. 
# we need y which is perpendicular sin = opp/hyp = y/ 2.1600000858306885
# calculate sin theta = 0.00871439889  thats a ratio in meters
# 0.00871439889 = y/2.1600000858306885 => y = 2.1600000858306885 * 0.00871439889 = 0.01882310235 

# x= 2.1559998989105225 y= 2.1559998989105225* sin(0.00871439889*2)  = 

# y not? array item is hypotenuse ur right. i made a mistake in plotting
# we have to find x also but use cosine



# so the lidar is moving with angular increment, while objects are also moving, is there only 1 lazer per unit time being shot?
# need to assume that for simplicity whaat is 1 ms?
# we have starting angle 
# angle_min: -3.1241390705108643
# angle_max: 3.1415927410125732

# ok, if our distance which is basically our sample list is less than equal to 2, we send a message
# else we ignore
# code that if condition now
